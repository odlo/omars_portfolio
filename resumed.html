I was a bill author my freshman year, and along with my two teammates, we wrote a bill on how Kentucky could better its environment through recycling. We studied endlessly and created a program which we thought was spot-on, although it was defeated in the Senate. </p>

I learned about Jazz band my freshman year through some of my friends who were in it, and since I didn’t want to lose my ability to play an instrument, I joined Jazz band. I was immediately welcomed despite the fact that I was not a part of the in school band, and everybody was excited that another trombone would be added to the small trombone section. There I met my music mentor and friend Kalvin, who would teach me everything that I wouldn’t be learning because I wasn’t in the school band. He helped me with Music theory, and learning the difference between playing straight eighth notes in Jazz and swing eighth notes. Over the years in Jazz band, we’ve built a large repertoire of music, including songs like Gloria Estefan’s “Turn the Beat Around,” and Duke Ellington’s “Mood Indigo.”</p>

                                <p>Pep Band is the official name of the conglomeration of students from Marching band that play at pep rallies and basketball games. We have to stay after hours until around 10pm on days where we have basketball games, and we have to leave class early to prepare for pep rallies. The difficult thing about Pep Band is that all of our music has to be memorized on our own time, and we don’t gather very often to practice Pep band music. </p>

I have to be a representative of the Latinx community, a representative of the LGBTQ+ community, and a representative of the best version of myself, so that I can make the program proud.</p>

                                <p>As a part of the Quick Recall team in middle school, I felt isolated because I wasn’t exceptionally good at anything. As a sophomore, I decided to try again, per my history teacher and Quick Recall coach, and joined the team. Quick Recall pits school team against school team and uses buzzers that allow the fastest student to answer first in trivia based matches. What makes Quick Recall challenging is its specificity. </p>

                                <p>I have always been told that I’m unathletic, and that I look like a stick. As someone who hates sports, I don’t know why I thought joining the wrestling team was a good idea. But, nonetheless, when someone told me that the wrestling team needed someone to fill in their position at the 106lbs spot, I felt as if it was destiny for me to join the wrestling team. I learned the basics of wrestling -- tackling, take-downs, pins, even attending a wrestling camp on a Saturday to better myself. During my first competition, I was so nervous that I began to shake. As soon as I got on that mat and the bell sounded, adrenaline completely overtook my body. I couldn’t even remember how to grab a leg and pin. I did get fourth place at a tournament once -- it was after gruesome training with my wrestling partner. I wrestled with my friend who was one weight class above me, so that it was easier for me to take down people who were smaller than him. I won a few matches thanks to training with him, including where I placed at JV Regionals . </p>

                                <p>As part of an English project, one of my close friends decided to pursue a service learning opportunity. She invited a select group of people to be part of a new service club -- Books With Buddies. Books with Buddies is a group which organizes book drives, but mainly, heads down to Fern Creek Elementary and reads books to English Second Language students in an attempt to better their understanding of the English language, and provide extra help outside of class. She was from Mexico, and didn’t know any English. At first she was shy, but in the coming weeks, she’d open up to me. A few weeks later I took on 3 more students with agrop of 3 friends, and together, we played with alphabet activities and spelling, as well as the sounds that letters make. I have learned through Books With Buddies, how to become a better teacher, and how to positively impact the lives of young children. </p>
